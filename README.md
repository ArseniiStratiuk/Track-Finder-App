# Track Finder App

 An app/GUI that is linked to a database called "chinook". User will be able to do a bunch of operations with a database (like searching information) through this program.
 
 It also uses [**CustomTkinter UI-Library by Tom Schimansky**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) to have a modern look. So install this module with pip to run the app file (App_GUI.py):
```
pip install customtkinter
```
